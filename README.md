# Student Stress Level Prediction (ML)

## Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to analyze factors contributing to student stress and predict stress levels based on lifestyle habits. It leverages both a general lifestyle dataset and specific survey response data.

## Datasets
* **`student_lifestyle_dataset.csv`**: Contains features such as study hours, sleep, and physical activity.
* **`Student Stress Level Survey (Responses).csv`**: Real-world survey data capturing student sentiment and stress indicators.

## Key Features
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing correlations between lifestyle choices and stress.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing survey data for modeling.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing ML algorithms to classify or regress stress levels.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebooks**
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
* **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
